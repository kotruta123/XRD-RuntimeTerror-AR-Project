# Marius's Personal Reflection

## Contributions

### AR Project:
1. Took part in brainstorming inital ideas for the project which ended up in choosing the idea of creating the AR game which included having a dragon who would shoot at spawned enemies. Decided to go with this idea because I found cool free dragon assets that everyone liked. 
2. Took part in implementing the found dragon assets by contributing to the asset's movement and flying and creating and implementing various sound effects for more immersion.
### VR Project:
1. Took part in the implementation process of assets, arraging them accordingly in the scene, adding coliders and physics to the ball and user interaction with the ball.
2. Helped implement the OVR Camera Rig, player movement and object interaction.

## AR Reflections
Working on the AR project was a unique opportunity to merge creativity with technical execution. One of the most rewarding aspects was seeing the dragon come to life in an augmented environment and witnessing how the sound effects contributed to an immersive experience. 
Challenges included trying to make animations fluid and getting spawning mechanics responsive to real-world surfaces. These challenges made me think out of the box and more critically, which further amped my problem-solving skills. Finally, I felt that AR had great potential to create an engaging and interactive experience, merging the physical world with the digital
## VR Reflections
The VR project was equally exciting, particularly as I delved into the technical details of creating a realistic and responsive environment. Perfecting the ball and pin physics required patience and precision, but the results were deeply satisfying. Setting up the OVR Camera Rig and controllers presented unexpected challenges, particularly when troubleshooting issues with the camera hierarchy. However, overcoming these obstacles taught me the importance of persistence and attention to detail.

One of the highlights of this project was testing the final product. Watching others interact with the VR environment we created, especially first-time VR users, was incredibly rewarding. Their reactions validated the effort and care put into crafting a realistic and engaging experience.
## Final Notes
Looking back, this semester has been a period of immense learning and growth. Both the AR and VR projects presented unique challenges, from technical troubleshooting to balancing realism and functionality. These experiences not only deepened my technical expertise but also fostered a greater appreciation for the potential of immersive technologies.

As for the future, I'm not sure I will further pursue gaining more knowledge in this domain. As a backend developer working with unity felt strange. Code was the least important thing to do and was very few. Can't say I enjoyed very much but it was defenetly a nice experience which opened my eyes at the VR/AR world.
