# Catalin's Personal Reflection

## Introduction
This semester, working on **AR** and **VR** projects has been an exciting journey of exploration and creativity. From designing assets to setting up realistic environments and crafting interactive player experiences, I had the chance to delve into various aspects of development. Along the way, I discovered the immense potential these technologies hold while also confronting their challenges and constraints head-on. This experience has given me a deeper understanding of the promise and practicality of **AR** and **VR** in shaping the future of digital interaction.

## Contributions

### AR Project:

- **Goblin Spawner**  
    I worked on the part of spawning the goblins, and on the script that would spawn the goblins randomly on the specific surface detected.

- **Dragon Movement**  
    I contributed to enhancing the dragon's movement to feel more realistic in augmented reality. By refining the movement mechanics and integrating animations, I worked to ensure the dragon's actions were fluid and responsive.


### VR Project:

- **Interaction & Physics**  
  I started experimenting diferrent interactions between the collision of the balls and the pins, working on diferret colliders, and masses. This allowed me to find the perfect settings, so that when the ball hits the pin(s) to work like in a domino, if the rigid body hits another one, the pieces will collide, and feel realistic.

- **Player Movement & Interaction**  
  I have set up the OVR Controller, and made the controllers to move the character by teleportation, grab, and throw objects. Also, the OVR Camera was set as the main camera making it to follow the controllers when the position of it changes (teleports). 
  
  Moreover, the handle controller was also made to be allowed to grab objects that it is close to, and bring it as close as possible to the controller, making the feel of grabing an object more realistic (only right controller), also made the right controller the one that teleports and grabs objects, and the left one the hand that switches the direction of the camera positioning of the player.

- **Reset Pins & Balls** 

  I have worked on the script that allowed to respawn the pins and balls of a specific alley (two in total) to the initial position, which will allow the player to replay on the same alley of bowling, as this is what also happens in the real life, the bowls come back, and the pins reset. There was no specific animation added to it, it is just a hard reset of the coordinates.


## AR Reflections
Working on augmented reality projects this semester has been an amazing experience, blending creativity and technical problem-solving. From designing interactive elements to refining environmental responsiveness, I gained a deeper understanding of what it takes to create realistic AR experiences. Balancing realism and functionality was often challenging, but seeing the final product come to life in the real world was incredibly rewarding. This journey not only highlighted the vast potential of AR technology but also emphasized the importance of user-centered design in creating seamless and engaging experiences.


## VR Reflections
Working on the VR project has been a fascinating experience, especially when it came to building realistic environments. I realized how important it is to get the physics right for each object—making sure they behave realistically when the player interacts with them. 

The movement of the player was another big focus, as even small details in how they navigate the virtual world can make or break the experience. It took a lot of tweaking to find the right balance between realism and smooth gameplay, which made the VR project for me even more interesting, allowing me to experiment, and play arround with all the physics and interactions, seeing small progress but at the same time it was imense, was definetly something that made me fell in love with it.

One of the most challenging parts for me of this project was to set up the OVR Controllers, and camera. It might sound easy, but somehow during the setup the hiearchy of them were a bit messed up, and it took a lot of hours and bad energy to figure out what is the problem, why the OVR Camera does not follow the controllers, as it could be easily seen how the camera was standing steady, and the controllers were teleporting.

One of the most enjoyable aspects was testing the final product. I even had my dad, who had never tried VR before, test the game to gather feedback on its realism and engagement. Watching his reactions and hearing his feedback affirmed that the hours spent perfecting the physics, interactions, and overall experience were well worth the effort.


## Final Notes

Reflecting on this semester, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of both AR and VR technologies and their vast potential. Each project revealed unique challenges, from hardware constraints to ensuring realistic physics and seamless user interactions. These experiences taught me to approach problems critically, make informed decisions, and that every small really detail matters.

Looking ahead, I am excited about the future of AR and VR as these technologies continue to evolve and become more accessible. Being part of this field has been an incredible journey, and I look forward to exploring new projects that can make me have the same emotions, and feelings, as the first ones.
