# Alexandru's Individual Thought

## Introduction
Working on both **AR** and **VR** projects this semester has been amazing and interesting. From designing assets to environmental setup and player interaction, I got the chance to explore many areas of development. Along this road, I came to see the great promise these technologies provide and also confronted their constraints head-on.

## My Share of Work

### AR Project:
- **Dragon Prefab & Animations**
Including the dragon's movement mechanics and animations, I designed the prefab. Ensuring the dragon felt alive and responsive in an augmented reality proved difficult, but once I seen it in action, it became really fulfilling.

- **Joystick functionality**:  
I used a joystick technique to let the dragon move more naturally on mobile devices. Minimising player irritation and preserving immersion depend on a flawless player input.

- **AR Plane Manager**  
I also worked on AR plane detection and management enhancement. I helped to make a more believable AR experience by making sure things were shown normally on surfaces in the player's environment.

### VR Project:
- **Object Placing and Environmental Creation**  
I configured almost the whole VR bowling game environment and arranged every object in the game area. I have put the objects in the bowling environment scene. I have tried to create a simple bowling club. Hopefully it is a beautifull and share a better player experience.

- **Interaction & Physics**  
  I worked with Catalin to handle physics to guarantee pins and bowling balls functioned authentically and worked on permitting interactions with many objects in the game area. It was interesting challenge to get the collision response of the ball exactly perfect.

- **Player Functionality**  
  The scoring system is fundamental in a bowling game, so I created and used the ability to track players' scores, so enhancing the experience to seem more like a real-world match.

- **Lighting Layout**  
  A feeling of immersion and the highlighting of the features of the surroundings depend on dynamic lighting. I set the lighting such that it changes to keep clarity and atmosphere even as the player moves.

- **Respawning/Reset Pins & Balls**  
  Maintaining constant game flow depended critically on ensuring correct pin and ball respawning after pressing the reset button. Although I didn't first arrange the pins and balls, I helped to improve and balance these systems.

## Considerations on AR
There are amazing chances for merging virtual components with the actual world in augmented reality. Still, I have discovered that **tracking** and **usability** remain the toughest obstacles. Not everyone wants to hold up a smartphone to explore AR; this might feel invasive and draining. Near future seamless experiences could be created in part by hardware enhancements including IR cameras and improved depth sensors.

Another important realisation was the need of **realistic interaction** and **a stable plane detection system** in convincing consumers that virtual items really belong in their actual environment. Working on the AR plane manager, I demonstrated the need of precise surface detection. The illusion can be broken even by minor plane detecting errors.

## Virtual Reality Reflections
Development of virtual reality was an intriguing blend of **technical difficulties** and **design creativity**. Creating a convincing setting for the bowling game called for realistic physics, lighting, and deliberate object placement. VR seeks to totally submerge the player, hence every aspect must be perfect.

Actually entering the virtual world is transforming, but it also makes clear how important it is to create natural relationships. I spent a lot of effort adjusting the bowling techniques to guarantee genuine pin response to strikes and spares and appropriate throw feel.

On the VR project i worked with Catalin to solve a lot of errors that ocured the development process. It was hard to adapt to new VR technologies in Unity. But also at the same time i have learned a lot about how to interact with them and how to solve the incoming problems.

Still another fascinating element is the **physical** and **social** aspects. Although VR requires a certain physical space, it is far more interesting when it lets for pleasant social contacts. Not everyone has a room big enough for free walking around. Though VR's obvious promise for immersive entertainment and teaching uses, this space need can restrict general adoption.

## Final Notes
Working on both AR and VR, I learnt generally that each of these developing technologies has particular challenges as **hardware constraints**, **user comfort**, or **learning curves** in the development process. Still, there is nothing like the thrill of seeing a dragon come to life on a phone screen or having bowling pins strewn in a virtual alley.

AR and VR development will keep expanding and get increasingly more accessible and potent as hardware changes and tools get more player-friendly. Looking forward to be part of their ongoing development, I am excited to explore what the future holds for these immersive technologies.
