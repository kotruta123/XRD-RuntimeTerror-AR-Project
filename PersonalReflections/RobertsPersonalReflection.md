# Reflection by Roberts Zustars

## Main Contributions

### AR Project:
- **Brainstorming the Concept**
I contributed to our initial idea regarding our AR game, and I was one of the people who suggested a dragon defending the gate. That was pretty exciting for me to create something that had fantasy and technology fused.

- **Fireball Mechanic**:  
I designed and created the fireball system, in which the fireballs have to spawn, aim at a distance and interact with an enemy.

- **Goblin Waves and Surface Manager**  
I created the system for spawning goblin waves, ensuring the gameplay increased in difficulty over time. Additionally, I worked on the surface detection manager using Unity's ARPlaneManager to anchor the game world onto real-world surfaces.


### VR Project:
- **Fixing Joystick Bugs**  
Helped debug this really annoying scenario where the joysticks do not move the whole player view into position in the VR game.

- **Reset Functionality**  
  Implemented the reset button so players can quickly reset the game by resetting pins and balls.


## Reflection
The AR and VR projects this semester have opened up new horizons for me. As someone who doesn't have much experience with Unity, I had to dive head first into learning while adding my bit to the team. Some frustrating moments were there, but numerous points of real satisfaction when things did finally click. 

## Augmented Reality Reflections
The AR project was just the right mix of fun and challenge. My favorite part was developing the fireball mechanic. I remember struggling to make the fireballs look and behave properly—at first, they either flew off in random directions or just passed through enemies without doing anything. When I finally got them to explode on impact and feel "real”, it was such a relief.

Another exciting challenge was developing the goblin wave system. That meant balancing the game so that there were periods of increased difficulty without overwhelming the player. Seeing the goblins appearing and moving toward the wall added a dynamic element to the game, which made the game feel more alive.

I also worked on the surface detection system to ensure the AR game world could be anchored to real-world surfaces. Surface detection and then anchoring the game world was the most challenging tasks for me. Surface detection was done using ARPlaneManager in Unity, but unfortunately the ARAnchor component failed to work as intended. Instead of sticking the game to the detected surface, the entire scene was often left in front of the camera, breaking the intended immersion. Frustrating, but then it taught me how even minor technical issues can greatly affect the user experience, and I would prioritise solving this problem for a future project.

## Virtual Reality Reflections
Virtual Reality came to me like stepping into a new world with a different dimension-theoretically and practically. In fact, the bowling game was easy as compared to the project on AR, but most of the technological problems were just as complex. Solving the problem with the joystick was one of those "aha" moments when I could truly feel like I was making the game better.

The other thing that excited me was adding the reset function. It was just one tiny little feature at first, but during testing, it became so clearly important in the overall flow of the game. Watching players reset the pins and balls with just one press made me realize just how things like that can make an experience much richer.

## Lessons Learned
One of the most important things I learnt this semester is how theory translates into practice. Those concepts like the continuum of reality and virtuality don’t exist in the pure air, they were things we had to consider when designing a game experience. I've come to understand how many of these decisions, even the smallest ones, require huge thought. For instance, there was that very little decision I had to take about creating fireball from scratch rather than using assets, it was not an aesthetics issue but uniqueness and how it would feel to have it in the game.

Personally, I learnt the meaning of careful testing and the art of persistence. There were times when I thought I had failed, but kept working and eventually got it all together, especially when many scripts wouldn't start or did things that seemed impossible to fix.

## Final Thoughts 
Then, looking back, I feel rather proud about it, knowing what the team has done. The dragon coming to life in AR and the bowling pins flying in VR are moments that remind me of why I love working on creative projects like this.

I just feel that augmented reality and virtual reality have really great potential, and the project has gotten me even more motivated to keep on discovering these technologies. There is still much learning to do, but I appreciate this opportunity and can’t wait to see what comes next.
